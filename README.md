# Mountain-Car-Reinforcement-Learning

This project focuses on training reinforcement learning agents to navigate the Mountain Car environment. The following algorithms were implemented and experimented with:

1. **Q-Learning:** A classic reinforcement learning algorithm that learns a Q-function to make decisions.

2. **Deep Q-Network (DQN):** An extension of Q-learning that uses a neural network to approximate the Q-function, allowing for more complex environments.

3. **State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA):** Another traditional reinforcement learning algorithm that updates Q-values based on state-action pairs.
